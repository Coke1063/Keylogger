To start the keylogger, run either one of the .bat files:
Start keylogger: runs the keylogger only when the terminal is running. Closing it will stop the keylogger.
Start keylogger-No terminal: runs the keylogger but the terminal can be closed without stopping the keylogger. To stop it, you must kill the task using Task manager. Look for "Python".
Key presses will be logged in Key_log.txt.
